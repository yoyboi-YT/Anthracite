# Anthracite
A simple, customisable JSON server.

## Getting Started
Copy main.py and ldb.json into any folder.
Open your CLI and run `python3 main.py`. It will ask you to configure it.
Open cfg.json and paste your API key, found in your Swift app.
  Don't have an API key? generate one with `generate.py` and paste it into your Swift app.
In the config, you can change read and write permissions.
When you've configured cfg.json, run `main.py` again and your server will start to serve.
It will print the IP and port, paste those into your Swift app.
