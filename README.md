# Anthracite
A simple, customisable JSON server.
(Don't expect security)

## Getting Started
Copy main.py into any folder.
Run main.py. It will generate ldb.json, cfg.json and a key (in cfg).
Open cfg.json and configure the port and permissions, and copy the key into your app.
Run server.py again, and it will serve ldb.json.
